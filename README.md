# CC_final_project_Shreya

This is my final project for my Creative Coding class (Fall 2022).

This is an interactive dating-sim created using p5.js.
Players click through scenes and select choices.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~ Welcome to Tandon High School! You're a new student and everyone seems to want to get to know you! ~
You'll meet your typical cast members:
The class president.
The childhood bestfriend.
The class clown.
The gangster.
Who are you going to be closest to by the end of the day?

Remember, your decisions are important!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main code for this project is located in restart_final_project/mySketch.js.

creative coding final script.pdf holds the script that was used to plan out the choices for this game,
and Roundtable Presentation.pdf presents all of the initial ideas I had for this project, including the idea that I ended up continuing with.
The Old Code folder holds the original code that I ended up scrapping and redoing.

Thank you to my friends for letting me use their faces for this project!

I hope you enjoy playing Drops In the Wind!
